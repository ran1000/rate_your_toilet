<h3>Spotaloo</h3>

A mobile first application for searching a proper toilet nearby. The main idea was to filter restrooms in the city creating a community driven review system, so that users can look for a toilet fitting a specific need.

We first develop a concept of our app defining the core user journey and we then make a prototype on Figma, a wireframe, and later a branded version of the same one.

The MVP of the project was developed by a team of 4 people in less than 10 days. It allows to look for a toilet, get the directions and rate the toilet. A logged-in user can additionally add a new restroom.
